7.1310 	EXP 	Question text: This online research is being conducted as part of the Student Investigator's undergraduate honours thesis. It focuses on how people react to pranking behaviour and factors that affect those reactions.
7.1410 	EXP 	Question text: In this study, you will be asked first to read several short accounts of actual pranks and then react to each (for example, how funny you did – or didn't – find that prank to be). You will then be asked to complete two short measures concerning your responses to how other people interact with you – specifically, how important feeling respected and dealing with anger are for you. Finally, we'll ask you to complete a brief demographic questionnaire that asks basic questions such as your age and gender (so that we can accurately summarize the study sample's characteristics in any future reports). After that, you'll be able to learn more about the study's purpose.
7.1635 	EXP 	Question text: We expect this study to take no more than 30 minutes of your time. Participation is voluntary. Although no direct benefits to you are anticipated, we hope that you will learn more about the variety of research methods that are employed to test psychological hypotheses. In appreciation for your participation, you will receive 0.5 participation credits toward your applicable Psychology class.
7.1785 	EXP 	Question text: The risks associated with participation in the study are expected to be no greater than what you might experience in your day-to-day life. Indeed, reacting to others' embarrassing or awkward experiences, as well as how we deal with how people treat us, are common experiences for many. Having said that, you may choose not to complete any proportion of the study but will still receive your 0.5 participation credit. If you do choose to withdraw from the study before reaching the end, we would ask that you please skip to the end to read the feedback letter. Once you have submitted your responses it is not possible to withdraw your consent to participate, however, as we have no way of knowing which responses are yours.

8.4753 	EXP 	Question text: Faculty Investigator: Dr. Chris Burris, Psychology (St. Jerome's). 519-884-8111x28213 (cburris@uwaterloo.ca)
8.4789 	EXP 	Question text: Student Investigator: Maya Karmakar-Johnson, Psychology (mkarmaka@uwaterloo.ca)
8.4823 	EXP 	Question text: We appreciate your participation, and we thank you for spending time helping us with our research. At the beginning of the study, you were informed that its focus was on how people react to pranking behaviour and factors that affect those reactions. We would now like to explain the purpose of the study in greater detail.
8.4917 	EXP 	Question text: Although many people view pranks as “harmless fun,” Burris and Leitch (2018) showed that pranking can sometimes serve as an outlet for sadistic motivation – understood as wanting someone else to feel bad, however briefly, because the thought of that makes oneself feel good. By their very nature, pranks involve a gotcha whereby the person being pranked is subject to some degree of physical or psychological discomfort – if that doesn’t happen, then the prank is declared to have “failed.”
8.5085 	EXP 	Question text: Importantly, Burris and Leitch (2018) showed that positive reactions to pranks – whether performed by the self or by someone else – were predicted by a joint tendency to feel disrespected and to have difficulty letting go of anger related to past insults. Having identified this combo as the “engine” driving sadistic motivation, Burris and Leitch argued that sadistic motivation’s ultimate goal is to boost back up a self that feels deflated or “squashed,” and that seeing another come to harm is a means to this end.
8.5216 	EXP 	Question text: This analysis of pranking raises a paradox: Most pranksters look happy, even giddy – they don’t look angry or hostile. Dijksterhuis and Aarts (2010) reviewed research suggesting that goals can drive behavior even when the goals are outside of awareness – that is, unconscious. With that in mind, the present study was set up to see whether the presumed ultimate goal driving sadistic motivation – that is, boosting the self – was operating nonconsciously.
8.5333 	EXP 	Question text: To do that, we attempted to create either a “mini-boost” or a “mini-squash” to the self outside of your conscious awareness. Thus, as you read each prank story and reacted to it, you were randomly assigned to any of three possible subliminal primes: (1) “you are awesome” (boost); (2) “you are nothing” (squash); or (3) “people are walking” (neutral). These primes appeared before the general story instructions, before each story, and before each reaction item. After that, we had you complete short versions of the disrespect sensitivity and anger rumination measures used by Burris and Leitch (2018) to identify people who are more or less likely to respond to “squashed” feelings by reacting positively to others’ discomfort. To ensure that any possible negative effect of the “squash” prime would be neutralized quickly, we asked everyone to reflect on a recent positive personal experience at the end of the study.
8.5563 	EXP 	Question text: We expected the most positive reactions to the prank stories to emerge among people who received the “squash” primes, and who already struggle more with feeling angry and disrespected.
8.5625 	EXP 	Question text: So, to be clear, we are indeed interested in how people react to pranking behaviour and factors that affect those reactions, but this study explored a very specific aspect of that – that is, nonconscious motivation, which we investigated by means of subliminal primes.
8.5705 	EXP 	Question text: We apologize that we did not alert to you our use of subliminal primes at the outset – but we hope you understand that, had we done so, you would have probably been on the lookout for (or trying to guess) the primes we were using, which would compromise their effectiveness. Although not all psychology research involves withholding information at the outset like this, there is sometimes no practical alternative that allows for a valid test of hypotheses such as ours concerning nonconscious nature of sadistic motivation. We hope this makes sense to you.
8.5844 	EXP 	Question text: So, to summarize:
8.5876 	EXP 	Question text: 1) Pranking is sometimes used as an outlet for sadistic motivation.
8.5907 	EXP 	Question text: 2) The ultimate goal of sadistic motivation may be to boost the self, even if at others’ expense. 
8.5941 	EXP 	Question text: 3) The present study used subliminal priming to test whether this hypothesized of boosting the self is operating outside of conscious awareness. 
8.5995 	EXP 	Question text: 4) To test our hypothesis, we had to withhold information concerning our use of subliminal primes initially.
8.6030 	EXP 	Question text: Given (4) just above, it is very important that you not discuss your experiences with any other students who potentially could be in this study until after the end of the term. If people come into the study knowing about our specific predictions, it could influence their results, and the data we collect would not be useable. Also, if you print off a copy of this post-study information page, please do not make it available to other students.
